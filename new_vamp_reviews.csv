m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Jennifer Heaton,FALSE,Alternative Lens,Fresh,1/15/2021,...Vampires vs. The Bronx is both an entertaining horror-comedy and a clever commentary on whitewashing and gentrification.

m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Filipe Freitas,FALSE,Always Good Movies,Fresh,11/19/2020,The non-elaborate scenarios and relaxed posture generate a likable indie flavor...
m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Rosa Parra,FALSE,Latinx Lens,Fresh,11/18/2020,A formulaic story with a refreshing cultural lens and social commentary.....A Latinx household is fully equipped for a possible vampire invasion.
m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Jordy Sirkin,FALSE,Jordy Reviews It,Fresh,11/16/2020,"Vampires vs. The Bronx is a refreshing take on vampire lore, using it as a means to highlight the horrors of gentrification."
m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Andrew Wyatt,FALSE,The Lens,Rotten,11/3/2020,A fun but slight horror-comedy that doesn't do much with its biting metaphor for urban gentrification.
m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Brandon Collins,FALSE,Medium Popcorn,Rotten,10/28/2020,"It wasn't painful, but I had high expectations...the jokes that did hit made me laugh..."

m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Paul Mount,FALSE,Starburst,Fresh,10/26/2020,"For all its vampiric snarling and slightly cheesy 1990s special effects there's no bloodletting at all in this nippy, sprightly little film that stars a great young cast of unknowns and plays gamely with all the familiar tropes of the vampire genre."
m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Matt Donato,FALSE,What To Watch,Fresh,10/26/2020,It's a Bronx-bred slice of socially conscious horror that also doubles as gateway horror for younger genre fans in training. Owns its bodega-hangout roots.
m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Ruben Peralta Rigaud,FALSE,Cocalecas,Rotten,10/19/2020,"Vampires against the Bronx isn't bad.... [but] that's not enough, in the end there is almost nothing left from the less than hour and a half that was worth remembering."

m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Mark H. Harris,FALSE,Black Horror Movies,Fresh,10/10/2020,"Vampires vs. the Bronx's well-executed humor, likable characters, stellar cast (including small but memorable roles by Method Man, Zoe Saldana and Chris Redd) and infectious energy are more than enough for a good time."
m/vampires_vs_the_bronx,Rohan Naahar,FALSE,Hindustan Times,Fresh,10/8/2020,"Given a subdued release on Netflix, the breezy little bear-hug of a movie gives a voice to the working class, and is just as passionate about the perils of gentrification as it is about the art of killing vampires."

m/blood_red_sky,Jonathan DeHaan,FALSE,Nightmare on Film Street,Fresh,8/25/2021,Blood Red Sky is a victim of its own pacing but it still delivers everything you're looking for in a good vampire movie (not to mention a good heist movie)

m/blood_red_sky,Scott Weinberg,FALSE,Thrillist,Fresh,8/18/2021,"Runs perhaps a bit too long for its own good, but the flick eventually benefits from nice pacing and several kinetic set pieces."
m/blood_red_sky,Travis Johnson,FALSE,Mr. Movie's Film Blog,Fresh,8/10/2021,There's something to be said for a film that knows exactly what it is and fulfills its remit to the level best of its ability.
m/blood_red_sky,Tom Meek,FALSE,Cambridge Day,Rotten,8/6/2021,A dull vampire thriller that could have been so much more.
m/blood_red_sky,Dennis Harvey,FALSE,48 Hills,Fresh,7/30/2021,"A high-concept contraption done well, Sky may be overlong (at 121 minutes) and silly, but is what it is-and it is fun."
m/blood_red_sky,Robert W. Butler,FALSE,Butler's Cinema Scene,Fresh,7/30/2021,It's an utterly ridiculous idea performed with such unflinching gravitas that somehow the whole lurid mess works.
m/blood_red_sky,Tatat Bunnag,FALSE,Bangkok Post,Fresh,7/30/2021,"With a mediocre second half and a film running a little too long, and perhaps some predictability, Blood Red Sky still delivers an action-packed violent thrill ride in a claustrophobic setting that creates an engaging horror story."
m/blood_red_sky,Paul Mount,FALSE,Starburst,Fresh,7/30/2021,"Blood Red Sky is a welcome blood-red treat, a proper horrific vampire story whose supernatural protagonists are more in line with the savage beasts of 30 Day of Night than the lovey-dovey saps of the Twilight saga."
m/blood_red_sky,Jennifer Green,FALSE,Common Sense Media,Fresh,7/30/2021,"Perhaps surprisingly given the campy premise (and some genre staples, like the cry, ""Does anyone on board know how to fly?!""), the character drama keeps you attentive."
m/blood_red_sky,Lee McCoy,FALSE,DrumDums,Fresh,7/28/2021,"With nail-biting tension and plenty of bloodthirst, it practically writes itself. There's a good mix of genre favorites like 30 Days of Night (the look) and Train to Busan (the heart)."
m/blood_red_sky,John Serba,FALSE,Decider,Fresh,7/27/2021,"The plot - well, it's ramshackle... But as it is, it's still good enough to elevate our heart rates."
m/blood_red_sky,Leo Brady,FALSE,AMovieGuy.com,Fresh,7/27/2021,"There may not be much deeper thought going into Blood Red Sky, but this is a thrilling, nasty vampire movie, soaring above the clouds, causing havoc on a 747."
m/blood_red_sky,Jeffrey Parkin,FALSE,Polygon,Fresh,7/26/2021,"There's a good movie in there, it just takes a lot of effort to get to and often gets lost in the noise."
m/blood_red_sky,Sarah Bea Milner,FALSE,Screen Rant,Fresh,7/23/2021,"It blends action-thriller suspense with horror and, although it never quite rises above the formulas of either genre, Blood Red Sky is still fun."
m/blood_red_sky,Matt Fowler,FALSE,IGN Movies,Fresh,7/23/2021,"Blood Red Sky is a touch overlong, but its good parts outweigh the plodding elements. The film never forgets the mother/son bond that fuels the drama, allowing all of the action and bloodshed to be informed by a maternal drive to protect and shield."
m/blood_red_sky,Brian Tallerico,TRUE,RogerEbert.com,Rotten,7/23/2021,The sense of surprise or playfulness that you would think is inherent in a 'Bats on a Plane' concept just isn't here.
m/blood_red_sky,Scott Campbell,FALSE,We Got This Covered,Fresh,7/23/2021,Blood Red Sky makes for a perfectly fine Friday night viewing.
m/blood_red_sky,Alan Zilberman,FALSE,Washington City Paper,Fresh,7/23/2021,"It delivers on its premise, so your enjoyment hinges on whether ""hijackers take over a plane, and vampire mom is on board"" sounds like great trash or irredeemable nonsense."
m/blood_red_sky,Josh Bell,FALSE,CBR,Rotten,7/23/2021,"For such a fun, attention-grabbing high-concept premise, the execution is disappointingly repetitive and dull."
m/blood_red_sky,Randy Myers,TRUE,San Jose Mercury News,Fresh,7/22/2021,"Director/co-writer Peter Thorwarth splatters the screen with gore while tossing in surprises, delirious preposterousness and even a few touching moments. It's grand fun."
m/blood_red_sky,Nick Rogers,FALSE,Midwest Film Journal,Fresh,7/22/2021,"There are many snarky snowclone titles you could apply to this sanguine slab of grab-bag genre fare. But it's so full to bursting with fiendish turns and unexpected thoughtfulness that such jabs are beneath this contemplative, carnage-laden curio."
m/blood_red_sky,Derek Deskins,FALSE,Edge Media Network,Fresh,7/21/2021,"As it is, ""Blood Red Sky"" is a perfectly fine horror action film, bathed in blood and accentuated with explosions. It won't surprise you, but it'll keep you entertained for most of its runtime."
m/blood_red_sky,David Ehrlich,TRUE,indieWire,Rotten,7/20/2021,"It's an intriguing dilemma - one that a better film would have done more to contrast against the hijackers' craven inhumanity - but ""Blood Red Sky"" fails to coagulate that conflict into action."
m/blood_red_sky,Nathaniel Muir,FALSE,AIPT,Fresh,7/20/2021,"One of the most original movies of the year comes with a premise that sounds too ridiculous to be good. Not quite as emotional as it would like, but still a lot of fun."
m/blood_red_sky,Matt Donato,FALSE,What To Watch,Fresh,7/12/2021,"'Blood Red Sky' is a transatlantic terror that blends action, excitement, and unexpected sweetness into what sounds like any Saturday night SYFY headliner but is so much more."
m/blood_red_sky,Justin Harrison,FALSE,The Spool,Rotten,7/11/2021,The intriguing ideas Blood Red Sky brings to play go to waste.
m/blood_red_sky,Meagan Navarro,TRUE,Bloody Disgusting,Fresh,7/9/2021,"It's the type of plot that screams action-horror spectacle, yet this high-altitude thriller defies expectations from the start. A beating heart of familial love pumps through the veins of this intense horror-thriller with a vicious take on vampire lore."
m/blood_red_sky,Sarah Musnicky,FALSE,Nightmarish Conjurings,Fresh,7/8/2021,Absolutely thrilling. BLOOD RED SKY will keep viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end.
m/night_teeth,Zach Youngs,FALSE,InSession Film,Rotten,7/2/2024,"Night Teeth could have been a pretty decent vampire/gangster mashup, but the convoluted nature of the world and the lackluster love plot sink it faster than a vamp can sink its teeth into a willing neck."
m/night_teeth,Cris Kennedy,FALSE,The Canberra Times (Australia),Fresh,8/23/2022,"A darkly comic and enjoyable Ulyssean journey through the LA nightscape and playing with genre vampire film tropes, supported by fun performances."
m/night_teeth,Keith Garlington,FALSE,Keith & the Movies,Rotten,8/16/2022,"While it’s hard not to snicker at a title like “Night Teeth”, it’s even harder to get in sync with this light and often lethargic attempt at a hip stylish vampire flick."
m/night_teeth,Rahul Desai,FALSE,News9 Live (India),Rotten,8/2/2022,"For a film that's all style, the design of the climax is rather troubling."
m/night_teeth,Scott Campbell,FALSE,We Got This Covered,Rotten,3/28/2022,"Night Teeth is a disappointing vampire thriller that's all style and no substance, leaving plenty of interesting world-building and unique mythology behind in favor of a formulaic story audiences will see coming from a mile away."
m/night_teeth,Chloe Harper Gold,FALSE,Dread Central,Fresh,3/14/2022,"Despite limited screen time for Megan Fox and a paint-by-numbers plot, the film satisfies as a visually stunning vampire thriller."
m/night_teeth,Jeff Nelson,FALSE,Showbiz Cheat Sheet,Rotten,2/12/2022,"Night Teeth mildly entertains, but it ends up being more of a nibble than a bite."
m/night_teeth,Michael Frank,FALSE,The Spool,Fresh,11/28/2021,"When the film leans into sex, blood, and the weirdness of the world, it oozes fun."
m/night_teeth,Shah Shahid,FALSE,Comic Years,Rotten,11/15/2021,"Night Teeth is yet another vampire story that is more of a one-night-in-hell type adventure that is interesting, but not great."
m/night_teeth,Jim Schembri,FALSE,jimschembri.com,Fresh,11/8/2021,"The type of congenial, easily digested vampire movie you can watch while doing the ironing."
m/night_teeth,Roxana Hadadi,TRUE,Polygon,Fresh,11/5/2021,"If considered purely as a straightforward love letter to the vampire genre, and an expression of affection for the clichés and tropes these movies use over and over, Night Teeth can be a good time."
m/night_teeth,Dennis Schwartz,FALSE,Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews,Rotten,11/4/2021,Nothing to sink your teeth into.
m/night_teeth,Shelli Nicole,FALSE,Thrillist,Fresh,11/1/2021,"In spite of its flaws, the gratuitous vampire violence and sexy-yet-creepy vibe make it worth the Halloween watch."
m/night_teeth,Valerie Complex,TRUE,Deadline Hollywood Daily,Fresh,11/1/2021,"Nothing special, but it is fun."
m/night_teeth,Jordy Sirkin,FALSE,Jordy Reviews It,Rotten,11/1/2021,Night Teeth reels you in with a vibrant concept but ultimately lacks a pulse within its execution.
m/night_teeth,Kate Erbland,TRUE,indieWire,Rotten,10/28/2021,"[Fry's] increasingly unhinged performance ensures that ""Night Teeth"" isn't an entirely bloodless flop, but even she stalls out as the film crawls along beyond a 100-minute running time."
m/night_teeth,Tori Preston,FALSE,Pajiba,Rotten,10/28/2021,"This is one of those movies where I contemplated turning it off the entire time, and I didn't because I respect my film editor, but also because there was just enough good stuff to keep me on the hook."
m/night_teeth,Sara Michelle Fetters,TRUE,MovieFreak.com,Fresh,10/27/2021,"Night Teeth is Collateral with fangs by way of Stephenie Meyer and, surprisingly enough, I don't mean any of that as a negative."
m/night_teeth,JK Sooja,FALSE,Common Sense Media,Rotten,10/27/2021,"While there's a fair amount of neon jazzy flair to the violence in Night Teeth, it all lacks a certain weight or heft, as if everything is a connect-the-dot moving picture."
m/night_teeth,Collier Jennings,FALSE,But Why Tho? A Geek Community,Rotten,10/25/2021,Night Teeth doesn't fully reach its potential thanks to an underdeveloped story and premise that feels like a disservice to its genuinely talented cast members and director.
m/night_teeth,Ferdosa Abdi,FALSE,Screen Rant,Fresh,10/24/2021,"Night Teeth is not reinventing the wheel, but it is a fun neon-drenched romp that will certainly quench viewers' thirst for vampire narratives."
m/night_teeth,Andrew Murray,FALSE,The Upcoming,Rotten,10/23/2021,"[A]s the night wears on, the Netflix flick demonstrates that it has a lot less bite than it thinks it does. A largely predictable plot, forgettable antagonist and shallow world-building make for an unsatisfying meal."
m/night_teeth,Nick Allen,TRUE,RogerEbert.com,Rotten,10/22/2021,Vampires are treated like one of many cliches in this underwhelming horror-action-comedy that has little charisma of its own.
m/night_teeth,Marissa Crenwelge,FALSE,Tell-Tale TV,Rotten,10/22/2021,"For all the glamour and glitz, there's very little meat at the inside of this story. Night Teeth doesn't give enough exposition to make you care about why any of the night's events are taking place."
m/night_teeth,Sean Collier,FALSE,Pittsburgh Magazine,Fresh,10/22/2021,"If Shakespeare had written a vampire romance, and then that romance were given a very loose 21st-century retelling, it would feel a lot like Night Teeth."
m/night_teeth,John Serba,FALSE,Decider,Rotten,10/21/2021,"I saved all the vampire puns for the end: Night Teeth is toothless, it's bloodless, it's got dull fangs, it sucks, it has no bite, it needs a good dentist, etc."
m/night_teeth,Austin Burke,FALSE,Austin Burke/Flick Fan Nation,Rotten,10/21/2021,"This story chooses to play it safe with the style and how deep it dives into the lore. Night Teeth features good chemistry between the main trio, but their journey is a bit too conventional."
m/night_teeth,Randy Myers,TRUE,San Jose Mercury News,Fresh,10/21/2021,"While this Netflix Halloween entry from director Adam Randall has its campy moments, it's just too long for its own good and would have been sharper if it shed 15 minutes or so."
m/night_teeth,Matt Fowler,FALSE,IGN Movies,Fresh,10/20/2021,"Night Teeth's winning lead trio and its glossy, electronic buzz save this Collateral clone from sinking into full nonsense"
m/night_teeth,DarkSkyLady,FALSE,DarkSkyLady Reviews,Fresh,10/20/2021,"Night Teeth entertains, despite its shallowness, thanks to the cast breathing life into the story."
m/night_teeth,Benjamin Lee,TRUE,Guardian,Rotten,10/20/2021,Night Teeth isn't quite as dreadful as its truly dreadful title but it's just as forgettable.
m/night_teeth,Tony Sokol,FALSE,Den of Geek,Fresh,10/20/2021,"Fry particularly shines. As cold and distant as she forces herself to be, the character is extremely likeable, and the actress brings subtle charisma throughout."
m/night_teeth,Matt Lynch,FALSE,In Review Online,Rotten,10/20/2021,Plays like someone made an entire movie based on the voiceover and opening blood-nightclub scene in Blade but without the cool part. This effort isn't worthy of [anyone's] talents.
m/night_teeth,Jeannette Catsoulis,TRUE,New York Times,Rotten,10/20/2021,A strangely listless vampire tale that unspools with some style and precious little sense.
m/night_teeth,Owen Gleiberman,TRUE,Variety,Rotten,10/20/2021,"The dark-side-of-the-L.A.-club-scene premise has potential, but the movie turns out to be a cut-and-paste thriller without any night-world bloom to it."
m/night_teeth,Matt Donato,FALSE,What To Watch,Rotten,10/20/2021,"'Night Teeth' doesn't paint the proverbial town as red as we'd hope, since the more exciting action elements of this underdeveloped vampire thriller are accented by flatness."
m/night_teeth,Brian Orndorf,FALSE,Blu-ray.com,Fresh,10/20/2021,"It's an entertaining ride with the creatures of the night and their mounting frustrations with their enemies, with Randall keeping matters lively as he sorts through exposition and character introductions."
m/night_teeth,Mark Dujsik,FALSE,Mark Reviews Movies,Rotten,10/20/2021,Night Teeth ... gives us an overly generic world of blood-sucking fiends and a plot to match it.
m/night_teeth,Jorge Rivera Rubio,FALSE,QiiBO,Rotten,10/19/2021,"Besides good effort by Lucy Fry, and a fun, sleek neon cinematography, this only helps us realize how much better other vampire movies and TV shows are. [Full review in Spanish]"

m/night_teeth,Sara Clements,FALSE,Daily Dead,Fresh,10/19/2021,"While Night Teeth has a few hiccups and is built around a pretty generic power trip narrative, it has well-crafted characters, exposition, and well-choreographed action sequences, all in a stylish package."
m/night_teeth,Robert Kojder,FALSE,Flickering Myth,Rotten,10/19/2021,"Even when it comes to familiar genre action, the film is still a failure"

m/night_teeth,Josh Bell,FALSE,CBR,Rotten,10/19/2021,Fox and Sweeney liven up the movie more in a few minutes than anyone else in the cast manages for its entire running time.
m/night_teeth,Fico Cangiano,FALSE,CineXpress,Rotten,10/19/2021,Lucy Fry stands out in this bland vampire ride along that lacks frights and thrills.
m/night_teeth,Meagan Navarro,TRUE,Bloody Disgusting,Rotten,10/18/2021,"Despite a likable lead and a constantly moving narrative, Night Teeth lacks bite and is sucked dry of any life."
m/night_teeth,Nick Rogers,FALSE,Midwest Film Journal,Rotten,10/18/2021,"Muzzled by a miniature canvas for multicultural touches, meaningful character interaction and monster lore, a miniseries idea folded to feature form. For a film about the collapse of a century-long human-vampire truce, it's frustratingly low-stakes."
m/night_teeth,Lauren Coates,FALSE,AwardsWatch,Rotten,10/18/2021,"While normally this type of film may still be salvageable to pulp fans if it had a sharp eye for aesthetics or a particularly gruesome edge to its fight scenes, Night Teeth can't even boast either of those elements in its favor."
m/night_teeth,Brent Hankins,FALSE,The Lamplight Review,Fresh,10/17/2021,Lendeborg Jr. is charming and affable as the hero of the story... but Fry's progressively deranged performance is easily the most entertaining and Night Teeth roars to life whenever Zoe decides to unleash a bit of chaos.
m/night_teeth,Nathaniel Muir,FALSE,AIPT,Fresh,10/17/2021,"A great performance from Lucy Fry is the highlight of an energetic movie that has some serious flaws. A youthful energy keeps things fun, but the plot is thin."

m/day_shift,Lee Zumpe,FALSE,Tampa Bay Newspapers,Rotten,10/26/2023,"“Day Shift” is only intermittently entertaining, leaving the viewer with a handful of rousing action sequences scattered across a mostly forgettable landscape populated with under-developed characters and materialistic vampires."
m/day_shift,Mini Anthikad-Chhibber,FALSE,The Hindu,Rotten,10/4/2023,Genre leaps from horror to buddy-comedy to action to family-friendly and to a road movie make for exhausting viewing.

m/morbius,Matthew Creith,FALSE,Matinee With Matt,Rotten,7/25/2023,"It's not that Morbius is bad, but that it is so bad that it's almost unwatchable. Matt Smith is a waste of great talent in a role that sees him go from practically paralyzed to supervillain in a matter of seconds."
m/morbius,Manuel Sao Bento,FALSE,MSB Reviews,Rotten,7/25/2023,"From the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting, unnecessary exposition, Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the characters."
m/morbius,Tina Kakadelis,FALSE,Beyond the Cinerama Dome,Rotten,7/25/2023,It comes as no surprise that the extremely delayed Moribus is not the finest superhero movie ever released.

m/morbius,Olivia Gacka,FALSE,SciFiNow,Fresh,4/7/2022,"Overall, this is an entertaining movie. It sucks you in with the action and standout scenes between some of the characters. But, while Morbius has the makings of a great anti-hero revival, it wavers with the execution."

m/salems_lot_2024,Cody Leach,FALSE,Cody Leach (YouTube),Fresh,10/2/2024,'Salem's Lot is an old-school spooky vampfest that delivers some solid scares with a dose of nostalgia for 70s/80s horror. You can tell the source material is likely a richer and deeper story but this new take is a fun & fast-paced good time.
m/salems_lot_2024,Randy Myers,TRUE,San Jose Mercury News,Rotten,10/2/2024,"Too often, though, it's listless and overloaded with bloodless characters."
m/salems_lot_2024,John Anderson,TRUE,Wall Street Journal,Rotten,10/2/2024,"Salem's Lot in this new incarnation resorts to being funny when it oughtn't, gruesome when it isn't required, and there is an awkward sense of not knowing quite where to run along the rocky shores of Maine."
m/salems_lot_2024,Nate Adams,FALSE,The Only Critic,Rotten,10/2/2024,What this Salem's Lot desperately needed was fresh invention.
m/salems_lot_2024,Jorge Rivera Rubio,FALSE,QiiBO,Fresh,10/2/2024,"Although lacking the depth of the themes explored in the original story, works perfectly as a movie to watch in the spooky season. "
m/salems_lot_2024,Joseph Robinson,FALSE,Fish Jelly Films (YouTube),Rotten,10/2/2024,To say this 3rd adaption of the Stephen King novel feels like a Lifetime horror film would be an insult to the Lifetime network.
m/salems_lot_2024,Joe George,FALSE,Den of Geek,Fresh,10/2/2024,"Dauberman understands the mood and tone of King's work. But by keeping it set in the past, the director undermines the full power of even his well-honed scares."
m/salems_lot_2024,Eric Goldman,FALSE,Eric Goldman (YouTube),Rotten,10/2/2024,There's a reason the previous versions of Salem's Lot were two-night miniseries. Almost all the characters lack the depth they have in the book and it's not effective enough as a horror movie to make up for it.
m/salems_lot_2024,Jamie Graham,FALSE,Total Film,Fresh,10/1/2024,Don't be put off by the long wait. This is a little slimline but a lot of fun.
m/salems_lot_2024,Benjamin Lee,TRUE,Guardian,Rotten,10/1/2024,A competently made yet hugely uninvolving retread that never once finds a way to explain why this particular novel needed a third adaptation.
m/salems_lot_2024,Nick Schager,TRUE,The Daily Beast,Fresh,10/1/2024,"A reasonably faithful and effective thriller, light on legitimate frights but polished and unnerving."
m/salems_lot_2024,Aaron Neuwirth,FALSE,We Live Entertainment,Rotten,9/30/2024,"After being shuffled around for a while, I can see why this film is making a streaming debut. It's not awful, but it leaves a lot to be desired."
m/salems_lot_2024,Cheryl Eddy,FALSE,io9.com,Rotten,9/30/2024,"It's not a bad movie. It's worth adding to your Halloween-season viewing queue. But watching it, you'll understand why Warner Bros. opted for a streaming releaseand likely agree with the decision."
m/salems_lot_2024,Bill Goodykoontz,TRUE,Arizona Republic,Rotten,9/30/2024,"If this sounds like a superfan complaining that a remake didn't live up to what he was hoping for, that's because it is. But it's also a movie critic complaining that even if you've never heard of Salem's Lot, it comes up short."
m/salems_lot_2024,Brian Eggert,FALSE,Deep Focus Review,Rotten,9/30/2024,"The most unfortunate aspect of Dauberman's version is that it doesn't last longer. At 113 minutes, the movie doesn't have the time to explore the relationships that drove King's story, nor does Dauberman prioritize them."
m/salems_lot_2024,Meagan Navarro,TRUE,Bloody Disgusting,Rotten,9/28/2024,"It's an adaptation that feels heavily tampered with, gutting all story and character development in favor of empty vampire scares."
m/salems_lot_2024,Chris Nashawaty,FALSE,AARP Movies for Grownups,Fresh,9/27/2024,"The third and latest iteration of Stephen King's 1975 novel isn't a great vampire movie, but it will do nicely until the next one comes along."
m/salems_lot_2024,Tom Jorgensen,FALSE,IGN Movies,Rotten,9/27/2024,One of the most aggravating Stephen King adaptations in recent memory.
m/salems_lot_2024,Lovia Gyarkye,FALSE,The Hollywood Reporter,Fresh,9/27/2024,The action sequences feature thrilling moments  some more intentionally funny than others  that make Salem's Lot perfect to watch with a crowd.
m/salems_lot_2024,Sharai Bohannon,FALSE,Horror Press,Fresh,9/27/2024,Gary Dauberman's script feels like it bared its fangs but was not ready to sink its teeth into anything. This results in wasting some fantastic set pieces in a movie that mostly plays it safe.
m/salems_lot_2024,Alan French,FALSE,Sunshine State Cineplex,Fresh,9/26/2024,"Despite some qualms with middling CGI and a less expansive version of the town, there's still a lot to like about this version of Salem's Lot."
m/salems_lot_2024,Tai Gooden,FALSE,Nerdist,Fresh,9/26/2024,"Salem's Lot brings the intensity, gore, and scares that one desires in a vampire story and uses the skeleton of Stephen King's source novel to craft new elements that you'll want to sink your teeth into."
m/salems_lot_2024,Fred Topel,FALSE,United Press International,Fresh,9/26/2024,Captures the best elements of Stephen King. It's scary and streamlined after two previous miniseries adaptations.
m/salems_lot_2024,Christian Toto,FALSE,HollywoodInToto.com,Rotten,9/26/2024,Misguided remake shows signs of life before devolving into quasi-camp.
m/salems_lot_2024,Robert Taylor,FALSE,Collider,Fresh,9/26/2024,"Dauberman's film is competent enough that I think it will manage to find an audience who's into an overly traditional take on vampire lore, as well as win over King fans who have been onboard with this tale, in all its incarnations, since day one."
m/salems_lot_2024,Cassondra Feltus,FALSE,Black Girl Nerds,Rotten,9/26/2024,"While it's effectively atmospheric and provides some genuinely creepy imagery, the rushed structure and wooden dialogue keep it from standing out as a truly scary horror film."
m/salems_lot_2024,Charlie Ridgely,FALSE,ComicBook.com,Fresh,9/26/2024,"For all of its flaws, of which there are several, Salem's Lot still makes for an enjoyable Halloween season watch."
m/salems_lot_2024,Megan Fisher,FALSE,Loud and Clear Reviews,Fresh,9/26/2024,"a crackling work of entertainment, with propulsive, enthusiastically constructed set pieces and a strong foundation in its classic source material."
m/salems_lot_2024,Chris Evangelista,FALSE,Slashfilm,Rotten,9/26/2024,"Even if you're unfamiliar with King's novel and therefore not comparing it to the source material, this new Salem's Lot will still feel unfulfilling. I'm glad this movie finally got released ... I just wish I liked it more. "
m/salems_lot_2024,Brian Orndorf,FALSE,Blu-ray.com,Fresh,9/26/2024,"It's on the shallow side, but there's definitely entertainment value here, especially for the Halloween season."
m/salems_lot_2024,William Bibbiani,TRUE,TheWrap,Fresh,9/26/2024,"A popcorn-spilling, shriek-inducing, tricky little treat."
m/salems_lot_2024,Courtney Howard,FALSE,Fresh Fiction,Rotten,9/26/2024,"Not goofy enough to be classified as camp and not serious enough sustain any indelible terrors, Salem's Lot comes up short of its potential. It leaves a lot to be desired."
m/salems_lot_2024,Josh Korngut,FALSE,Dread Central,Rotten,9/26/2024,"Despite its occasional scares and striking style, this adaptation lacks any of the terror or emotional depth of its Stephen King source material."
m/salems_lot_2024,EJ Moreno,FALSE,Flickering Myth,Fresh,9/26/2024,"In many ways, this is the ultimate Stephen King adaptation. Everything you could love about his work is here, and it's a throwback horror romp."
m/salems_lot_2024,Stephen A. Russell,FALSE,"Flicks (AU, NZ, UK)",Rotten,9/26/2024,"Doesn't hit as hard, with an iconic window scene from the Hooper version, the terrifier of countless childhoods, less impactful here thanks to an overreliance on computer trickery, a recurring problem stalking contemporary horror movies."
m/salems_lot_2024,Casey Chong,FALSE,Casey's Movie Mania,Rotten,9/26/2024,This long-delayed remake could only muster some bites.
m/salems_lot_2024,Emmanuel Noisette,FALSE,The Movie Blog,Fresh,9/26/2024,"Salem's Lot is a thrilling and entertaining ride that will satisfy horror fans, but with a slightly lighter touch than other horror films."
m/salems_lot_2024,Bill Bria,FALSE,Discussing Film,Fresh,9/26/2024,Salem's Lot (2024) is far better than some Stephen King fans might be expecting thanks to how much fun it has with the source material.
m/salems_lot_2024,Alexander Harrison,FALSE,Screen Rant,Fresh,9/26/2024,"Salem's Lot tries to be both a compelling drama and a cool, scary movie, only for those two halves to end up holding this horror movie back."
