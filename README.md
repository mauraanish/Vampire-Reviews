# Vampire-Reviews
In the Fall 2024 semester, I chose to analyze reviews of vampire movies for my final project in my DACSS 758: Text as Data course, taught by Dr. Rosemary Pang at UMass Amherst. I wanted to learn about which words are commonly used by movie critics to favorably describe vampire movies and develop models to predict whether a critic's vampire movie review is positive or negative.
